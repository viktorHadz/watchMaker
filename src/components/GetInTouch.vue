        I'm happy to take on repair work of all kinds — vintage, modern, quartz, automatic... if
        it's built to be fixed, I will be glad to take a look. Leave me a message and we can decide
        what it needs.

      <li class="mt-4 text-base/7">
        If you're a watchmaker yourself and stuck on something, feel free to reach out. I’m always
        up for problem-solving, sharing ideas, or just trading notes on the bench.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-4 text-base/7">
        And if you just love watches and want to chat — that’s welcome too. Always good to hear from
        fellow enthusiasts.
